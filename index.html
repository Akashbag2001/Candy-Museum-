                            "Let's Get Busy", or "Miss You". Sweethearts were made by the New England Confectionery

                            Necco, before being purchased by the Spangler Candy Company in 2018. They were also

                        <p class="lead">A doughnut or donut (IPA: /doʊnət/) is a type of leavened fried dough. It is
                            popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be
                            homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty
                            vendors. 'Doughnut' is the traditional spelling, whilst 'donut' is the simplified version.
                            The two terms are often used interchangeably in the English language.

                            Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, but other types of batters can also be
                            used. Various toppings and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar,
                            chocolate, or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar,
                            oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.

                            The two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut, which is injected
                            with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. Alternatively, small pieces
                            of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Once fried, doughnuts may be glazed with a
                            sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate on top, or topped with powdered sugar, cinnamon,
                            sprinkles or fruit. Other shapes include rings, balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other
                            forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake (including the old-fashioned) and
                            yeast-risen type doughnuts. Doughnuts are often accompanied by coffee, but can also be
                            paired with milk. They are sold at doughnut shops, convenience stores, petrol/gas stations,
                            cafes or fast food restaurants.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Candy, known also as sweets and confectionery, has a long history as a familiar
                            food treat that is available in many varieties. Candy varieties are influenced by the size
                            of the sugar crystals, aeration, sugar concentrations, colour and the types of sugar used.

                            Simple sugar or sucrose is turned into candy by dissolving it in water, concentrating this
                            solution through cooking and allowing the mass either to form a mutable solid or to
                            recrystallize. Maple sugar candy has been made in this way for thousands of years, with
                            concentration taking place from both freezing and heating.

                            Other sugars, sugar substitutes, and corn syrup are also used. Jelly candies, such as
                            gumdrops and gummies, use stabilizers including starch, pectin or gelatin. Another type of
                            candy is cotton candy, which is made from spun sugar.

                            In their Thanksgiving Address, Native peoples of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy give special
                            thanks to the Sugar Maple tree as the leader of all trees "to recognize its gift of sugar
                            when the People need it most". In traditional times, maple sugar candy reduced from sap was
                            an important food source in the lean times of winter in North America.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Gummies, gummi candies, gummy candies, or jelly sweets are a broad category of
                            gelatin-based chewable sweets. Gummi bears and Jelly Babies are widely popular and are a
                            well-known part of the sweets industry. Gummies are available in a wide variety of shapes,
                            most commonly colourful depictions of living things such as bears, babies, or worms. Various
                            brands such as Bassett's, Haribo, Betty Crocker, Disney and Kellogg's manufacture various
                            forms of Gummi snacks, often targeted at young children. The name "gummi" originated in
                            Germany, with the term "jelly sweets" more common in British English.
                            The gummi bear originated in Germany, where it is popular under the name Gummibär (rubber
                            bear) or Gummibärchen (little rubber bear). Hans Riegel Sr., a maker from Bonn, produced
                            these sweets under the Haribo company, which he started in 1920.
